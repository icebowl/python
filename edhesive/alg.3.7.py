'''
When we read code and predict its output, it is called tracing code.

For this lesson you will come up with your own challenging algorithm for other students to trace. 
It must contain at least 5 - if statements and use at least one AND or OR boolean condition. 
Run it in the sandbox, then copy and paste your code in Piazza for other students to try.

For this challenge try reading 3 or 4 other students' code - 
trace the code and predict what it outputs, 
then run it in the sandbox to see if you got it right.
