'''
A chatbot is a computer program designed to emulate human conversation. 
For this program you will use if statements, user input, 
and random numbers to create a basic chatbot.

Here is the scenario: you have decided to start a website. 
You are creating a prototype to show investors so you can 
raise money and launch your website.

You should ask the user at least five questions and use if-elif-else 
statements and give answers depending on how they answer. 
Some responses should be based on what they type, 
and some should be based on random numbers.

For example, if they say they are sad, 
your chatbot might respond “I’m sorry to hear that”.

You could also have a random number generated between 1 and 3 
and have a corresponding response depending on the number such as 
“That is great to hear” or “So interesting”.
